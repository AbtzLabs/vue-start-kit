Just another boring starter kit ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) apps made with interesting libraries such as [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org) (package bundler), [PugJS](https://pugjs.org), [TypeScrit](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Seed-CSS](http://abtzlabs.github.io/seed-css/) (lightweight CSS boilerplate)!

**Found a bug üêû?**

- [Open an Issue](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/issues) and I'll take care of it;
- Or you can fix it and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/pulls) üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## What do you get using this?

- üöÄ Suuuuuper fast app
- üôå Very clean and simple file structure
- üî• Live programing environment (with Hot Module Replacement)
- üéØ Functional programing concepts
- üí™ A stable code-base with TypeScript
- üòá No webpack config file (using ParcelJS instead)
- ‚úÖ A well commented and easy to understand source-code

## Get started

```sh
# 1. clone this repository ...
$ git clone https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit.git [YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]

# 2. install all the dependencies ...
$ npm install

# 3. start the (live) development environment.
$ npm start
```

üëâüèª Change `[YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]` with a name for your app.

A new tab will open in your (default) browser prointing to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).

From now, everything you change on the source-code will trigger an imediate update on the browser (_without refresh_) preserving the current state of your new app.

## Contributing

Contributions are veeeery welcome and are expected to be made through [pull requests](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/pulls). As for now, I don't have any contribution guidelines in place, so, please don't be evil. üòâ You can simply start by:

1. Forking this repository;
2. Changing and implementing what you think necessary;
3. Implementing the Unity Tests (with MochaJS);
4. Submitting a pull-request.

Before start coding, tho, just make sure to first run this in a terminal window (from inside the project directory) and you'll be ready to start.

```sh
$ npm start
```

## Unit tests

Unit tests are written using `MochaJS` and they can be found in `tests/`. Simply run the following command on a terminal window, when inside your project folder to run the unity tests:

```sh
$ npm test
```

## Building for production

Run the following command on a terminal window, naturally when inside your project folder. All the outputs (the distribution package) will be placed in the `/dist` folder.

```sh
$ npm run build
```

I can't simply write about how this project can boost your projects development start in VueJS or about how much it costs to me (time and money-wise) to build an open-source tool available to everyone. What I can tell you is I'm really doing this with all the good wishes to help other developers (just like myself).

If you want to help keeping me motivated and working on such cool projects (which usually are done in the time I was supposed to spend with my family), please consider:
