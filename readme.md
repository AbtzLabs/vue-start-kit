<br/>

Just another boring starter kit for Vue applications made with interesting libraries such as [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org) (package bundler), [PugJS](https://pugjs.org), [TypeScrit](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eva-Icons](https://akveo.github.io/eva-icons/) and [Seed-CSS](http://abtzlabs.github.io/seed-css/) (lightweight CSS boilerplate)!

Found a bug? [Open an Issue](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/issues) or [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/pulls).

## What you get using this?

- üöÄ Suuuuuper fast app
- üôå Very clean and simple file structure
- üî• Live programing environment (with Hot Module Replacement)
- üéØ Functional programing concepts
- üí™ A stable code-base with TypeScript
- üòá No webpack config file (using ParcelJS instead)
- ‚úÖ A well commented and easy to understand source-code

## Get started

```sh
# 1. clone this repository ...
$ git clone https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit.git

# 2. install all the dependencies ...
$ npm install

# 3. start the (live) development environment.
$ npm start
```

A new tab will open in your default browser prointing to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).

From now, everything you change on the source-code will trigger an imediate update on the browser (without refresh) preserving the current state of your new app.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome and are expected to be made through [pull requests](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/pulls). As for now, I don't have any contribution guidelines in place, so, please don't be evil. üòâ You can simply start by:

1. Forking this repository;
2. Change and implement what you think necessary;
3. Submit your pull-request.

Before start coding, run this in a terminal window from inside the project directory.

```sh
$ npm start
```

## Unit tests

Unit tests are (supposed to be) written using `MochaJS` (but they are still pending) and can be found in `tests/`. Simply run the following command on a terminal window, when inside your project folder:

```sh
$ npm test
```

## Building for production

Run the following command on a terminal window, naturally when inside your project folder. All the outputs (the distribution package) will be placed in the `/dist` folder.

```sh
$ npm run build
```

## Be a Sponsor

I can't just write about how this project can boost the start of your projects in VueJS or about how much it costs to me (time and money-wise) to build an open-source tool available to everyone. But I can trully tell you that I do this with all the love from the bottom of my heart and all the good wishes to help other developers (just like myself) which can eventually become real costs and sacrifices.

If you want to kick in to help me cover _those costs_, that would be awesome!
