This's just another boring starter kit ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è for [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) apps made with interesting libraries such as [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/), [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org) (package bundler), [PugJS](https://pugjs.org), [TypeScrit](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Seed-CSS](http://abtzlabs.github.io/seed-css/) (lightweight CSS boilerplate)!

**Found a bug üêû?**

- [Open an Issue](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/issues) and I'll take care of it;
- Or you can fix it and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/pulls) üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## What do you get using this?

- üöÄ Suuuuuper fast app
- üôå Very clean and simple file structure
- üî• Live programing environment (with Hot Module Replacement)
- üéØ Functional programing concepts
- üí™ A stable code-base with TypeScript
- üòá No webpack config file (using ParcelJS instead)
- ‚úÖ A well commented and easy to understand source-code

## Get started

```sh
# 1. clone this repository ...
$ git clone https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit.git [YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]

# 2. install all the dependencies ...
$ npm install

# 3. start the (live) development environment.
$ npm start
```

üëâüèª Change `[YOUR-AWESOME-APP-NAME]` with a name for your app.

A new tab will open on your (default) browser prointing to [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/).

From now on, everything you change in the source-code will trigger an imediate update on the browser (_without refresh_) preserving the current state of your new app.

## Contributing

Contributions are _veeeery_ welcome and are expected to be made through [pull requests](https://github.com/AbtzLabs/vue-start-kit/pulls). As for now, I don't have any contribution guidelines in place, so, please don't be evil. üòâ You can simply start by:

1. Forking this repository;
2. Changing and implementing what you think necessary;
3. Implementing the Unity Tests (with MochaJS);
4. Submitting a pull-request.

Before start coding, tho, just make sure to first run this in a terminal window (from inside the project directory) and you'll be ready to start.

```sh
$ npm start
```

## Unit tests

The unit tests are written using `MochaJS` and they can be found in `tests/`. Simply run the following command on a terminal window, when inside your project folder to run the unity tests:

```sh
$ npm test
```

## Building for production

Run the following command on a terminal window, naturally when inside your project folder. All the outputs (the distribution package) will be placed in the `/dist` folder.

```sh
$ npm run build
```
